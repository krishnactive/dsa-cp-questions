In OpenGL, the extern keyword is used to declare a variable or function as being defined in another source file. 
However, it's not commonly used with GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) functions. GLUT functions are typically included via header files, and you don't usually need to explicitly declare them as extern.

srand():-  The srand() function is used in C and C++ programming to seed the random number generator provided by the rand() function. The random number generator generates pseudo-random numbers based on the seed value. Pseudo-random numbers are not truly random but are generated in a deterministic way that appears random.
