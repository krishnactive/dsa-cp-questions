The line `vector<int> v(n, -1);` initializes a vector named `v` with `n` elements, and each element is set to -1. Here's a breakdown of what this line does:

- `vector<int>`: This declares a vector of integers. A vector is a dynamic array-like data structure in C++ that can store multiple values of the same type.

- `v(n, -1)`: This part initializes the vector. The `n` in parentheses specifies the number of elements the vector should have. The `, -1` initializes each of these elements with the value -1.

So, after this line executes, you'll have a vector `v` containing `n` elements, and all elements will be initialized to -1. This can be useful as a placeholder or default value for elements in certain situations, especially when you want to indicate that the value hasn't been set or used yet.

For example, if you later decide to populate this vector with actual values, you can replace the -1 values with the appropriate data. Here's a simple example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    int n = 5; // Number of elements in the vector
    std::vector<int> v(n, -1);

    // Populate the vector with some values
    v[0] = 10;
    v[2] = 25;
    v[4] = 50;

    // Display the vector
    for (int num : v) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we initialized a vector of size 5 with -1 values, and then we assigned specific values to certain elements in the vector. The output would show something like: `10 -1 25 -1 50`.
